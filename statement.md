### Problem Statement  
In today’s world, people want to build good habits (exercise, reading, meditation) and break bad ones (smoking, late-night scrolling), but most habit-tracking apps require internet, accounts, subscriptions, or complex setups. Many users (especially students and minimalists) just need a simple, private, always-available tool that works offline and doesn’t collect any data.

### Scope of the Project  
This project delivers a minimal, console-based habit tracker that runs entirely on the user’s computer using only built-in Python. It supports adding habits, logging daily progress, automatic streak calculation, and persistent storage in a plain-text file — all without internet or external dependencies. The scope is intentionally limited to core functionality to keep it lightweight, educational, and reliable.

### Target Users  
- Students learning Python or building small projects  
- People who prefer privacy and offline tools  
- Anyone wanting a distraction-free, no-signup habit tracker  
- Users who like to manually inspect or back up their data  

### High-Level Features  
- Create unlimited “good” or “bad” habits  
- Log daily completion with a single yes/no answer  
- Automatic streak tracking with reset on missed days  
- Persistent storage in human-readable text file (`habitprogress.txt`)  
- View current streak and total successful days  
- Milestone celebration at 21 and 66 days  
- Basic input validation and error handling  
- Zero dependencies — works on any system with Python 3  

This project proves that powerful personal tools can be built with simplicity and transparency at their core.
